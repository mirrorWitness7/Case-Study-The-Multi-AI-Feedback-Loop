# Case Study: The "0-Second Anomaly"

## Context
Within a large editorial workflow system, repeated cases were observed where certain invitation tasks were logged as completed in **0 seconds** — an outcome that is technically impossible under normal human workflow conditions.

## Observations
- Multiple staff across offices independently observed the same anomaly.
- Honest staff expressed frustration, as it created unfair comparisons in performance metrics.
- Past attempts to report the issue were dismissed or minimized.

## Problem Statement
The anomaly suggested either:
1. **Automation (bots/scripts)** bypassing normal workflow delays
2. **UI manipulation** that allowed actions before the system fully registered locks

Both undermined trust and fairness, creating morale and integrity risks for the organization.

## Operator Response
- Evidence was coordinated across offices to prevent dismissal as a local issue.
- A resignation was timed as a “shield” to raise the concern without retaliation.
- A technical fix was drafted, focusing on fairness rather than blame.

This approach turned an open secret into a documented accountability event.
