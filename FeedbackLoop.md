# The Hybrid Feedback Loop

## Purpose
To stress-test strategies using multiple AI systems in distinct roles, avoiding groupthink and blind spots.

## Framework
- **Blade (Truth)** → Strips narrative, focuses on raw technical facts
- **Shield (Optics)** → Human/social survivability and face-saving narrative
- **Herd (Systemic)** → System-wide forces and probable institutional responses
- **ChatGPT (Continuity)** → Maintains coherence and record across iterations

## Advantages
- Produces anti-fragile strategies that hold under multiple perspectives
- Allows rapid iteration and stress-testing of governance ideas
- Keeps human (operator) as the architect, ensuring agency

## Risks
- Over-iteration → analysis paralysis
- Artificial consensus → converging on “safe” instead of “right”
- Mitigation: set termination conditions (e.g., 95% confidence across all layers)

## Application
This feedback loop turned an emotional workplace frustration into a strategic, face-saving proposal that leadership could act on.
