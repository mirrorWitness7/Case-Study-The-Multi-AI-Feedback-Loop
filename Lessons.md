# Lessons for Governance & Integrity

## Key Insights
1. **Pattern Recognition Matters**  
   - Small anomalies (0-second logs) can reveal systemic flaws.
2. **Cross-Office Corroboration Works**  
   - Distributed evidence prevents dismissal as “local error.”
3. **Face-Saving is Critical**  
   - Solutions must allow leadership to fix problems without loss of authority.
4. **Technical-Social Link**  
   - Technical loopholes directly create social unfairness and morale collapse.
5. **Exit Shielding**  
   - Timing reports with a planned exit allows accountability without retaliation.
