# Proposed Technical Fix

## Root Cause
The “Proceed” button in the system frontend could be triggered **before backend confirmation**, creating an exploitable gap.

## Solution (Low-Cost)
1. **Backend Confirmation First**  
   - Button activation depends strictly on server-side lock confirmation.
2. **Forced Delay (1–2 sec)**  
   - Ensures automation cannot bypass human-speed baselines.
3. **Randomized Jitter**  
   - Adds slight randomness to timing, blocking predictable scripts.
4. **Logging & Audit**  
   - Every action timestamp is recorded, enabling traceability.

## Benefits
- Restores fairness by removing shortcuts.
- Simple to implement; minimal cost.
- Improves morale without requiring public scandal.
- Allows leadership to frame this as **“process optimization”** rather than past failure.
